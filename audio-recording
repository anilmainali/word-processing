Audacity has good filters.

But it is difficult for me to use.

Here are the steps:

0. New file
0. Click record (red roud button on the icon bar).
0. talk as long as I can until I make a mistake.
0. Click stop (square yellow button).
0. File Export
0. Spefiy a file name. I sequence them
0. Specify a file
