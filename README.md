How I prefer to use Microsoft Word with friends.

It seems everyone has their own pet peeve when using Word.

Here are mine.

## File name version control
Word has its own versioning (in the Review tab) because 
it's just too scary to look into the complex markup under the Print view.
So I prefer to use file names as version control.

In file names I've learned to never use spaces to avoid other mangling them.
The format of a file name:

   Subject Subfile Version Date Sequence Initials .doc

Example:

   Git_all_v09_2016.03.22a_wm.doc

The lower case "v" is short for version.
Lower case because it makes the number following it easier to read than if a capital is used.
Obsessive, I know, but I'll go to my grave happier because of this ;)

Dots are used within dates so they are not confused as something else.

Initials of the author is very important when collaborating.

## Fonts
Fonts should be loaded before opening files since Word does substitutions without saying anything.

I like the Open Sans Light font.
Its use saves ink. But that's irrelevant.

Open Sans font files have .ttf extension because they are TruType format
used on both Mac and Windows.

Under the Finder of any version of Mac OS X, navigate to <strong>/Library/Fonts</strong>
and drop downloaded font files there.

## Rename
Word makes changes to files even if it's only opened and immediately closed.
So before I open a file, I use Finder/File Explorer to make a copy of the file and
rename it. Then I open that new file.

## Save it often
I've had shed too many tears about lost work.
Before closing the screen and leaving it open,
I make it a habit to save files to a cloud server (Google Drive).

A few seconds has saved me hours of rework and frustration.

## Review
As soon as I open a file, I click the Review tab.
The default display is to show markup.

I click Next to go through changes made in the previous version/edition.

Then I click the little arrow next to the Accept icon and 
<strong>Accept all changes in document</strong>
so I start editing with a clean slate.
If I later need to see what was changed, I can run a Compare.

For use during editing, I set <strong>Tracking to Final</strong>.

I leave Track Changes to ON.

## On-screen TOC and Styles
From the menu at the top View | Sidebar | Document Map Pane
puts a table of contents on the left.
I usually have to drag the divider over a bit to show more text.

I usually stay on the Home ribbon so styles are visible.
Sometimes the ribbon gets collapsed. 
I then click the up/down arrow at the upper right to reveal it again.

I make heavy use of styles, so I prefer clicking the button that floats a list of styles,
which I keep on the right side of the screen.
The <strong>Clear Formatting</strong> at the top of the list I use a lot.

There are way too many default styles, so I get rid of ones I don't use,
and make up ones of my own.
