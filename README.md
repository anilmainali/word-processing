It seems everyone has their own pet peeve when using Microsoft Word.

Here are mine.

## File name version control
Word has its own versioning (in the Review tab) because 
it's just too scary to look into the complex markup under the Print view.
So I prefer to use file names as version control.

In file names I've learned to never use spaces to avoid other mangling them.
The format of a file name:

   ```
   Subject Subfile Version Date Sequence Initials .doc
   ```

Example:

   ```
   Git_all_v09_2016.03.22a_wm.doc
   ```

The lower case "v" is short for version.
Lower case because it makes the number following it easier to read than if a capital is used.
Obsessive, I know, but I'll go to my grave happier because of this ;)

Dots are used within dates so they are not confused as something else.

Initials of the author is very important when collaborating.

## Fonts
Fonts should be loaded before opening files since Word does substitutions without saying anything.

I like the Open Sans Light font.
Its use saves ink. But that's irrelevant.

Open Sans font files have .ttf extension because they are TruType format
used on both Mac and Windows.

Under the Finder of any version of Mac OS X, navigate to <strong>/Library/Fonts</strong>
and drop downloaded font files there.

BTW, Word needs to be restarted for it to recognize new fonts.


## Rename
Word makes changes to files even if it's only opened and immediately closed.
So before I open a file, I use Finder/File Explorer to make a copy of the file and
rename it. Then I open that new file.

## Save it often
I've had shed too many tears about lost work.
Before closing the screen and leaving it open,
I make it a habit to save files to a cloud server (Google Drive).

A few seconds has saved me hours of rework and frustration.

## Configure
Autocorrect automatically capitalizes the beginning of 
program commands, which is not helpful.

So I turn them off in 
menu Word | Preferences | AutoCorrect.

## Review
As soon as I open a file, I click the Review tab.
The default display is to show markup.

I click Next to go through changes made in the previous version/edition.

Then I click the little arrow next to the Accept icon and 
<strong>Accept all changes in document</strong>
so I start editing with a clean slate.
If I later need to see what was changed, I can run a Compare.

For use during editing, I set <strong>Tracking to Final</strong>.

I leave Track Changes to ON.

## On-screen TOC and Styles
From the menu at the top View | Sidebar | Document Map Pane
puts a table of contents on the left.
I usually have to drag the divider over a bit to show more text.

I usually stay on the Home ribbon so styles are visible.
Sometimes the ribbon gets collapsed. 
I then click the up/down arrow at the upper right to reveal it again.

I make heavy use of styles, so I prefer clicking the button that floats a list of styles,
which I keep on the right side of the screen.
The <strong>Clear Formatting</strong> at the top of the list I use a lot.

There are way too many default styles, so I get rid of ones I don't use,
and make up ones of my own.

## Table of Contents
I usually prefer to change an existing document rather than 
starting from scratch.

I think it helps to have a larger font for Heading1 and 2.

If a heading has a different text (such as "ACTIVITY"),
it helps for lower items to be indented.

## Vertical Spacing

I try to avoid blank lines of Normal style.

Insert a page break at the front of each Heading 1 and 2.

## My Styles

I try to avoid using Normal on purpose
because Word uses that for weird stuff.
It's unavoidable in front of page breaks.

* **Body** is the default.

* **Action Step** sequentially numbers steps for readers to take.

* **PROTIP** (Best Practices)

* **Bullet 1**

* **Bullet 2**

* **Coding**

* **File Path**

* **Heading 1, 2, 3, 4**

* **Note**

* **Picture**

* **Remember**

* **Table Column Heading**

* **Table Contents**

* **URL**

* **Figure Caption**


## Bolding fonts
An unfortunate aspect of Open Sans (and some other fonts) is that
bolding is difficult to see.

So we need to use a character style **Bold [PACKT]** instead
of simply pressing control/command+B after highlighting.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Word for Mac 2011 does not honor standard Mac keyboard shortcuts.
Especially annoying are Mac keys for top and bottom of document
(command + up and down arrow).

Microsoft offers this sorry list of keyboard shortcuts:

Where is the Page Down key on the Mac?

## Copying and pasting
If you copy text from one Word document and paste it in another 
using Command/Ctrl+V, a style from the originating document
may be created.

So it's better to use <strong>Paste Special</strong> then
select Unformatted Text.

## Voice command
It's tedious to select styles using the mouse.

So I'm experimenting with voice command of Office applications.
